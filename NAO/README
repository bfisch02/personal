This directory includes the source code for an undergraduate research project I worked on last year. The goal of the project was to create a website that would allow children to write stories that the NAO robot would ultimately narrate and perform.

I completed this project the same semester that I took my first web programming course, so I had very little web programming experience at the time. The project gave me the opportunity to try out tons of new techniques, and it taught me how much fun designing a user interface can be.
